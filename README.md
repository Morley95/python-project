# python-project
Project for Core Training

This mini-project is used to calculate the area of various 2-D Shapes

The program will ask the user to identify which shape they wish to calculate the area for,
should the user input an invalid command it will ask the user again to enter a valid command,
esc is the command used to escape the program.

If a user inputs a shape e.g. square, the program will ask them for the appropriate measurements,
in this case the program would ask for the length of the height and the base of the square. Upon
entering in these measurements, the program will calculate the area of the shape. A counter was also
implemented to keep track of how many calculations for area were performed during the session. The user
can keep calculating different shapes until they type esc command to escape the program. Upon exiting the program
the display counter for how many areas that were calculated is shown, along with a goodbye message.
